# Unexpected Routing Behavior in React Router DOM v6

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to unexpected routing behavior in React Router DOM v6. The issue is not immediately apparent in simple routing scenarios but manifests when dealing with nested routes or route parameters.  The bug is characterized by routes seemingly working correctly at first, but then displaying unexpected behavior under certain conditions, such as navigation or page refresh.

## Bug Description

The primary symptom is that navigation to certain routes either fails completely or takes the user to an unintended location.  This inconsistency makes debugging and identifying the root cause challenging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages.  Initially, routing appears to work correctly.
5. Try adding more complex nested routes or introduce route parameters to observe the erratic behavior. 

## Solution

A solution involves meticulously examining route definitions for potential conflicts, ensuring accurate route parameter handling, and using debugging tools to trace the navigation process within React Router.
